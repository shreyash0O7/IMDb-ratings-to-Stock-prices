# IMDb-ratings-to-Stock-prices

The document contains comments and meeting notes related to a code project proposal. The purpose of the code is to analyze stock prices of companies on a month-to-month basis. The main outcome variable is stock returns, and the code aims to determine the causal effect of movie releases on stock prices. The code also includes text analysis based on individual people's reviews for each movie. The code will consider the changes in Vanguard 500 and the Media Company Index as control variables. The overall goal is to analyze the response of investors and the market to movie's IMDb ratings and their impact on stock prices.
